Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won\u2019t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won\u2019t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\n**I&#39;M ALL ABOUT CUSTOM ORDERS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLES PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DISCOUNT PRICE, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITHIN YOUR BUDGET**\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

That means it will hold onto the cold for a long, long time.\n\nIt isn&#39;t out of a mere sense of Canadiana that I&#39;ve put each DrinkPuck in a hollowed out hockey puck. No sir. The puck serves several purposes:\n- in a modern fridge that is mostly wire grid, the puck makes your DrinkPuck easier to find.\n- it helps to protect the relatively soft soapstone from getting damaged from anything else in the freezer.\n- turn the puck over and it makes a great coaster.\n- plus, yes, it is a great bit of Canadiana.\n\nI used to make the little cube-shaped whisky stones, but found this shape to be more pleasing as well as fitting into a glass better.\n\nEach DrinkPuck will store enough cold energy to chill down one small, measured drink in a couple of minutes. Put it back in the freezer to recharge for your next drink. It will be cold again in 10-20 minutes, depending on how long it has been out. Keep this in mind when ordering. If you intend to have few drinks in a row (who am I to judge?), you might want to order more than one DrinkPuck. Also, it depends on how many friends you have over. If you drink alone ... well ... again, I&#39;m not one to judge.\n\nThe soapstone is quarried in Quebec, Canada and driven to my production facility by teams of husky beavers. I cut and polish each DrinkPuck personally. The hockey pucks are the same ones used in the NHL, just hollowed out with an appropriately sized hole. Those are harvested after their prime growing season from Czechoslovakian lowland puck bushes where my agents purchase and dry them. The finished pucks are then flown to Canada where they are finished and prepared for sale to you.\n\nOkay. Some of that is a lie. I am Really Horrible, remember?\n\nDrinkPucks make great groomsmen&#39;s gifts as well as unique presents for Christmas, birthdays or just to surprise a good friend. Who needs a reason to spread around how awesome you are? Give these for a good reason or no reason at all, and you&#39;ll be fondly remembered forever. Hallowe&#39;en? Why not. Easter? Go for it.\n\nWhen you receive your DrinkPucks, they will be a medium grey colour. After the first use, each will begin to darken. Don&#39;t worry. This is normal, and desirable. The surface is oxidizing a bit and building up a nice barrier. Soapstone is impermeable to liquids already and an inert material, so no liquids or odours will soak in.\n\nCaring for your DrinkPucks is simple. Rinse and put back in the freezer. You can dry them if you want. You can even run them through the dishwasher if you have to, but I&#39;d advise against it. That would break down the lovely patina on the surface. Remember, soapstone is soft, as stone goes. You can probably scratch it with your fingernail.\n\nAfter all that, please enjoy responsibly. Do not &#39;drop the puck&#39; into your drink. That could damage the glass, your precious liquor, and the DrinkPuck. The preferred method is to turn the glass upside down over a DrinkPuck in your other hand. Then invert. Boom.\n\nI also suggest using straight-sided glasses. Your DrinkPuck is a weighty piece of stone, and may have unpredictable and surprising results in tulip-shaped glasses. Nobody finds that hockey-player-grin attractive.\n\nI&#39;ve been told that some people use their DrinkPucks in mugs of beer or wine. Please keep in mind that it may help to keep an already cold mug of beer cold, but won&#39;t chill down an already room temperature beverage very efficiently. Also, unless you drink your wine out of a coffee mug, I wouldn&#39;t suggest putting them into your lovely stemware, either.\n\nI know the shipping is high. Canada Post prices are available on their website. I&#39;m flinging rocks through the mail here. The shipping prices listed are for a maximum of 4 in a standard package. If you want more than that, I&#39;ll have to package them differently and will make a custom listing for you that includes the shipping. Feel free to send me a convo about that first.\n\nDrink Right.\nDrinkPucks.","creation_tsz":1460722394,"ending_tsz":1471263194,"original_creation_tsz":1377269484,"last_modified_tsz":1460722394,"price":"15.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":22,"tags":["hockey","gift","gifts","scotch","whisky","whiskey","bourbon","bar","father","drink","groomsmen","groomsman"],"category_path":["Housewares"],"category_path_ids":[69150425],"materials":["soapstone","puck"],"shop_section_id":14094073,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1448368113,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/160502279\/drinkpucks-1-in-rubber-hockey-puck-case?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1410,"num_favorers":106,"shipping_template_id":745530209,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":891,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":493550815,"hex_code":"78664F","red":120,"green":102,"blue":79,"hue":34,"saturation":34,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1377269484,"listing_id":160502279,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_75x75.493550815_lnlw.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_170x135.493550815_lnlw.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_570xN.493550815_lnlw.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_fullxfull.493550815_lnlw.jpg","full_height":1295,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":493550895,"hex_code":"AC7F21","red":172,"green":127,"blue":33,"hue":41,"saturation":80,"brightness":67,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1377269484,"listing_id":160502279,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_75x75.493550895_iqqj.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_170x135.493550895_iqqj.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_570xN.493550895_iqqj.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/024\/0\/5177929\/il_fullxfull.493550895_iqqj.jpg","full_height":1395,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":892028584,"hex_code":"6C675C","red":108,"green":103,"blue":92,"hue":41,"saturation":14,"brightness":42,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450741329,"listing_id":160502279,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/113\/0\/5177929\/il_75x75.892028584_sn8e.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/113\/0\/5177929\/il_170x135.892028584_sn8e.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/113\/0\/5177929\/il_570xN.892028584_sn8e.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/113\/0\/5177929\/il_fullxfull.892028584_sn8e.jpg","full_height":1250,"full_width":1250},{"listing_image_id":892028714,"hex_code":"AFADAA","red":175,"green":173,"blue":170,"hue":36,"saturation":2,"brightness":68,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1450741329,"listing_id":160502279,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/5177929\/il_75x75.892028714_evnt.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/5177929\/il_170x135.892028714_evnt.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/5177929\/il_570xN.892028714_evnt.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/138\/1\/5177929\/il_fullxfull.892028714_evnt.jpg","full_height":533,"full_width":708}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5177929,"shop_name":"ReallyHorrible","user_id":5186795,"creation_tsz":1183048878,"title":"Really Horrible Enterprises","announcement":"The worldwide corporate headquarters and product research laboratory of Really Horrible Enterprises is located in a secret, underground bunker in the mountains of eastern Ontario, Canada.\r\n\r\nEvery product you see here is made with great and deliberate care by a very funny man in a kilt.
